    <h2>Intro</h2>
    Welcome to the personal site of Tad Cordle! This is the home for my game dev portfolio/personal projects.<br /><br />
    
    My latest big personal project is <a href="projects/sensorium.html">Sensorium</a>, an open-world puzzle-exploration game about the 5 senses.<br /><br />
    
    Yes, I know this website looks dated and ugly. But look how fast it is!<br /><br />
    
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    I started thinking about making games as early as 2001, when I was in the 1st grade, coming up with crazy ideas that I wanted to eventually be made into games. Eventually, I discovered Game Maker in 2004, which I used to build some really simple, shitty games (some of these early projects can still be found under "Old Game Projects" on my <a href="projects/index.html">Projects page</a> for the sake of... preserving history? Humor? You decide). Game Maker was my first experience with "programming", at first with drag-and-drop, and eventually with its GML scripting langauge.<br /><br />
    
    I started learning how to properly program in late 2008, when I enrolled in a CS academy, where I learned languages such as Java, Visual Basic, and C#. I eventually picked up XNA Game Studio, which I was able to use to build a few small game projects with the help of my new programming skills.<br /><br />
    
    I graduated high school and went to UMBC, where I majored in computer engineering. I also joined the school's <a href="http://umbcgdc.github.io/">Game Developers Club</a>, where I developed an interest in not just game programming, but effective game design as well. Check out my projects page for more info on what I worked on as part of this club!<br /><br />
	
	These days, I'm a full time gameplay programmer at Media Molecule, working on an unannounced project.<br /><br />
